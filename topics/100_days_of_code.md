# 100 Days of Code

### Day 1: May 20, 2020

First time journaling my coding journey. Today, I started the last project of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Section: [building a personal portfolio website.] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

Did about an hour of coding today and established the file structure and overall layout of my personal portfolio. Nothing fancy so far. 

### Day 2: May 21, 2020

Worked on the personal portfolio project for freeCodeCamp quite a bit today. Built the sticky navbar, landing page, projects sections, and contact/footer section. All on one HTML page. I used CSS Grid to develop the overall layout and it worked pretty well. Honestly, I'm surprised at how versatile CSS Grid is. I initially thought it was another way to align items like Flexbox, which it can do, but being able to create layouts with `grid-template-columns/rows` allows for much greater freedom and power than something like Flexbox. Almost done with the website, just need to add my projects in and make it responsive for mobile. 

### Day 3: May 22, 2020

Today, I finished freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum and received a certificate of completion.

I first started freeCodeCamp on February 28, 2019 and almost one year later, I finally finished their responsive web design portion. However, I know that this past year, I haven't been diligent at all in learning front-end web development. I was always interested in front-end web development, but I never start learning about it because I was afraid to start. There are just so many technologies and paths out there about this career field, so I was intimated and scared about just starting. Then, in my junior year of college, I took a course titled "Intro to Coding for Journalists." It was an awesome course and it was what I needed to ignite my spark, my motivation to self-learn front-end web development. 

So yeah, around the time I was taking this course in college, I started freeCodeCamp. I breezed through the tutorials, but when it came time to complete the actual projects, I had **no idea** what I was doing. While I was looking at the HTML file on Chrome, I was wondering why my content, my code wasn't working the way I wanted it to. That's when I realized that my problem stemmed from the course I took in college which taught exclusively with Bootstrap. Everything I knew about front-end web development was from Bootstrap. I didn't know how to center in CSS, how to use Flexbox or CSS Grid, SASS, a lot of core front-end web development skills were just completely foreign to me. Therefore, I had to start over and learn from scratch. I had to learn front-end web development from the ground up. After countless udemy  (thanks Brad & Jonas!) and YouTube tutorials, I finally have a good grasp of HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM, and responsive web design. 

It's been a long road, but my front-end web development career is only just starting. Tomorow, I finally start learning and messing around with JavaScript. Am I nervous? For sure. Am I excited to get started? You bet. 

### Day 4: May 23, 2020

I graduated from UT Austin today, virtually of course. Anyways, I updated my portfolio website today with the template. It's looking pretty good actually, very mobile-responsive too. Finally, I started Wes Bos Beginner JavaScript course. Let's see how it goes. (P.S. I uninstalled pop os and moved back to windows on my main laptop)
