# 100 Days of Code

### Day 1: May 20, 2020

First time journaling my coding journey. Today, I worked on the last project of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Section: [building a personal portfolio website.] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

Did about an hour of coding today and established the file structure and overall layout of my personal portfolio. Nothing fancy so far. 

### Day 2: May 21, 2020

Worked on the personal portfolio project for freeCodeCamp quite a bit today. Built the sticky navbar, landing page, projects sections, and contact/footer section. All on one HTML page. I used CSS Grid to develop the overall layout and it worked pretty well. Honestly, I'm surprised at how versatile CSS Grid is. I initially thought it was another way to align items like Flexbox, which it can do, but being able to create layouts with `grid-template-columns/rows` allows for much greater freedom and power than something like Flexbox. Almost done with the website, just need to add my projects in and make it responsive for mobile.
