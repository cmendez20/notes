# Web Design

### Overview of Website Personalities

1. **Serious/Elegant**: For luxury and elegance, based on thin serif typefaces, golden or pastel colors, and big high-quality images
2. **Minimalist/Simple**: Focuses on the essential text content, using small or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and few images and icons
3. **Plain/Neutral**: Design that gets out of the way by using neutral and small typefaces, and a very structured layout. Common in big corporations.
4. **Bold/Confident**: Makes an impact, by featuring big and bold typography, paired with confident use of big and bright colored blocks
5. **Calm/Peaceful**: For products and services that care, transmitted by calming pastel colors, soft serif headings, and matching images/illustrations. [Octave](https://findoctave.com)
6. **Startup/Upbeat**: Widely used in startups, featuring medium-sized sans-serif typefaces, light-grey text and backgrounds, and rounded elements
7. **Playful/Fun**: Colorful and round designs, fueled by creative elements like hand-drawn icons or illustrations and animations.

### Web Design Rules #1: Typography

1. Use Only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
2. It's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality:
   1. Choose the right personality for your website
   2. Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
   3. Experiment to find a good fit
4. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range
5. Use a font size between `16px` and `32px` for **"normal" text**
6. For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of `20px` or even bigger
7. For **headlines**, you can go really big (`50px+`) and bold (`font-weight: 600+`), depending on personality
8. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular) because it will be hard to read
9. Use less that 75 characters per line (for a good reading experience)
10. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
    1. the **smaller** or **longer** the text, the larger the line height needs to be!
11. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will comes from experience)
12. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing
13. Usually, don't justify text
14. Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.

### Web Design Rules #2: 

#### Choose The Right Color

1. Make the main color match your website's personality: colors convey meaning!
2. Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors.
3. You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color
4. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent colors (use a tool)
5. For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" (tints and shades)
6. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page
7. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or section stand out
8. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations

#### Colors and Typography

9. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background ("lighter version") for text
10. Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting
11. Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors
    1. Contrast ratio needs to be at least **4:5:1 for normal text** and **3:1 for large text (18px+)**

### Web Design Rules #3: Images and Illustrations
#### Use Good Images

1. Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns
2. Use images to support your website's message and story. So only use relevant images!
3. Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images (not generic ones!)
4. Try to show real people to trigger user's emotions
5. If necessary, crop images to fit your message
6. Experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns

#### Handling Text on Images

7. **Method #1**: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
8. **Method #2**: Position text into neutral image area i.e. empty white space
9. **Method #3**: Put text in a box

#### Some Technical Details

10. To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions **2x as big** as their displayed size
    1. **Scale factor:** Actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represented on screen
    2. On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)
11. **Compress images** for a lower file size and better performance
12. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the **exact same dimensions**

### Web Design Rule  #4

- **Shadow creates depth (3D)**: the more shadow, the **further away from the interface** the element is

1. You don't have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality
2. Use shadows **in small doses**: don't add shadows to every element!
3. Go light on shadows, don't make them **too dark!**
4. Use **small shadows** for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
5. Use **medium-size shadows** for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
6. Use **large shadows** for elements that should really **float above** the interface
7. Experiment with **changing shadows** on mouse interaction (click and hover)

### Web Design Rule #5

1. Position important elements closer to the top of the page, where they get more attention
2. Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get more attention)
3. Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements
4. For text elements, use font size, weight, color, and whitespace to convey importance
5. What text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons
   1. You can de-emphasize less important text, like labels or secondary/additional information
6. Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow, or border (or multiple)
7. Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B
8. What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.
