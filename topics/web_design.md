2. **Minimalist/Simple**: Focuses on the essential text content, using small or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and few images and icons

### Web Design Rules #1: Typography

1. Use Only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
2. It's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality:
   1. Choose the right personality for your website
   2. Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
   3. Experiment to find a good fit
4. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range
5. Use a font size between `16px` and `32px` for **"normal" text**
6. For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of `20px` or even bigger
7. For **headlines**, you can go really big (`50px+`) and bold (`font-weight: 600+`), depending on personality
8. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular) because it will be hard to read
9. Use less that 75 characters per line (for a good reading experience)
10. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
    1. the **smaller** or **longer** the text, the larger the line height needs to be!
11. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will comes from experience)
12. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing
13. Usually, don't justify text
14. Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.
